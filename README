To build you need:

1. Install the Android SDK and the Android NDK

2. Set env var ANDROID_SDK_ROOT to be the path where the Android SDK was installed
(most commom in Ubuntu is ~/Android/Sdk)

3. Set env var ANDROID_NDK to be the path where the Android NDK was installed

4. Accept SDK Licenses if you already didn't:
    $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses

5. Run ./gradlew assembleDebug


Notes:
Available Android libraries can be located at $ANDROID_NDK/platforms/android-<api-level>/arch-<architecture>/usr/lib
